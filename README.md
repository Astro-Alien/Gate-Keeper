# Gatekeeperv2 #

Version 1 of the project can found at https://github.com/Group-24-PRT262S/Gatekeeper, it is no longer being worked on.

Project recreated in Maven, this was done to eliminate the need to include the driver for sql in the source folder which we would constantly need to maintain, instead we just included the link into the pom.xml.
