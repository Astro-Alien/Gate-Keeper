Version 1 of the project can found at https://github.com/Group-24-PRT262S/Gatekeeper, it is no longer being worked on.

Project recreated in Maven, this was done for several reasons but the main reason was to eliminate the need to include the driver for sql in the source folder, instead we just included the link into the pom.xml.
